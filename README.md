This project focuses on enhancing stock price prediction for the NSE Bank Index using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models. The primary objective is to build robust models that can accurately predict stock prices, aiding investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

Key features of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Ensuring high-quality input data through handling missing values and normalization.
Model Development: Implementing and evaluating models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, LightGBM, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Employing techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.
Reproducibility: Setting random seeds across all libraries to ensure consistent results.
Evaluation Metrics: Using RMSE, R-squared, and bias to assess model accuracy and reliability.
Ethical Considerations: Addressing data privacy, transparency, and the broader social implications of predictive modeling.
The project demonstrated that while Linear Regression and LightGBM provided the most accurate predictions, deep learning models like RNN and LSTM required careful tuning to handle the complexity of stock price data. The repository includes all code, data preprocessing steps, model implementations, and detailed documentation to facilitate understanding and replication. This project serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in applying machine learning to financial market predictions.
